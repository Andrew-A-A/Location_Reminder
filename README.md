# Location_Reminder
The Location reminder app is a powerful tool that helps users set reminders based on their current location. With this app, users can easily select a point of interest on the map, add a reminder, and specify the title and description for the reminder. The app uses geofencing technology to trigger notifications when the user enters a specific location. Additionally, the app provides a user-friendly interface for managing reminders, including the ability to view, edit, and delete reminders. With Location Finder, users can stay organized and never miss an important task or event based on their location.
